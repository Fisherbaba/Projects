#Student Performance Analysis
##Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze student performance data. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a linear regression model to predict final grades based on various factors.

Features
**Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and removing unnecessary predictors.
**Feature Engineering**: Creating dummy variables for categorical features.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
**Linear Regression Model**: Building and evaluating a predictive model.
**Assumption Checking**: Validating model assumptions using statistical tests.
Installation
To run this project locally, you will need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using the following commands:


The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing student performance data. The dataset includes various predictors such as previous grades, parental support, and more. The target variable is the final grade.


**Data Preprocessing**
Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., student ID, school).
Checked for and handled any missing values.
Created dummy variables for categorical features like gender and parental support.
Combined the processed data into a final dataset ready for analysis.
**Modeling**
Split the data into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split.
Built a linear regression model to predict the final grade.
Evaluated the model using R-squared and other relevant metrics.
Checked model assumptions using statistical tests and visualizations.
**Evaluation**
The model was evaluated using the following:

**R-Squared Value**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
**Residual Plots**: Checked the distribution of residuals to validate normality assumptions.
**Results**
The linear regression model provided a reasonable prediction of student final grades based on the available data. Further tuning and additional features could enhance model performance.
